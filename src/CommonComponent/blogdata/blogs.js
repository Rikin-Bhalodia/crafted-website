      <p>
        For ages now, Indian women have been wearing one of the most ancient and
        prominent traditional attire called Saree. The attire has since the
        beginning flooded the Indian market with different price tags ranging
        from 100 INR up to Approximately 1000000 INR. The Saree Attire comes
        along with innerwear commonly known as the Saree Petticoat. This
        innerwear gives an ideal shape to your saree and makes you feel
        comfortable in your saree. Due to a variety of saree designs and
        colours, it has always been a challenge for most Indian women to select
        a perfect colour saree petticoat to match the colour of the saree. If
        you are not so well skilled with matching colours, you may end up
        wasting much of your time and effort. Some even go home without a
        matching petticoat.
      </p>
      <p>Now, this is where TCOMaC comes in.</p>
